# Paper 3 analysis


This repository exists to run the analysis for the third paper in my PhD. 

It draws on the contents of repositories [SC 1930](https://github.com/j-jayes/SC-1930) for the census data and [Electricity map image processing pipeline](https://github.com/j-jayes/electricity-map-image-processing-pipeline) for the data on power stations.

It has a python file that creates a Stata dataset which is used to run the regressions. The python file allows us to select different control groups and thresholds for robustness.
