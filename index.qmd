```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


How do I want the map to be?

First I show the map of Sweden

Then I show the location of Olidan and Alvkarleby

Then I show how the power lines expanded across the country.

Then I show the locations of the power stations and transformers.

Then I show the treated and control parishes, and calculate the first stage.

Then I exclude parishes that have Olidan and Alvkarleby, and show still large effect.

Finally I do first stage matching and show still large effect.

Then onto results:

- Employment

- Income

- Inequality

Then onto mechanisms.
